# What is nodeJS
* NodeJS is nothing but a JS run time environment.
* NodeJS was developed by Ryan Dahl. 
* Every browser has their own JS engine like google has V8 engine which help brower to execute JavaScript. But we can only use JS on client side. 
* Rayn Dahl realised the potential of JavaScript and thought is bringing it's power outside of the browser.
* He taken the V8 engine code which was written in C++ and embed that with some more C++ code or we can call it as a wrapper. This wrapper provides us some functionality which V8 engine cannot. Like FileSystem, machine level computation, network handling and all and also allows us to use JavaScript outside of the browser

## You can download node from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/prebuilt-installer)

**Note** that npm is also downloaded along with node itself. It is a package manager which contains all the packages needed to run your application.

---

Once the node is downloaded, you can go to terminal and type in : 
```
node -v //to check the version of your node
npm -v //to check the version of npm in your system
node   //This will create a Node REPL in your terminal where you can do basic JS programming
```
